# Simple-Chatbot

I have created a sample chatbot for the Build Fast with AI assignment, using Neo4j knowledge graph retrieval instead of ordinary vector embedding retrieval for more efficient semantic preservation. The database used is the public website for Build Fast with AI, and the assistant will answer all related questions. I have made a simple chatbot for the assignment, it is only a textual assistant. I can build upon this, and include multi-modal and deeper conversation history with more enriched responses if given a chance to work together. The streamlit link will be sent in the assignment alongside this link. I hope you enjoy my chatbot!
